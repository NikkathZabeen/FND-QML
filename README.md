# Fake-news-detection-QML

A Quantum Machine Learning (QML) approach to detecting fake news using quantum computing techniques.

## Overview

This project implements a fake news detection system leveraging quantum machine learning algorithms. By utilizing the principles of quantum computing, this approach aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying misinformation in news articles.

## Features

- *Quantum Machine Learning*: Utilizes quantum algorithms for classification tasks
- *Fake News Detection*: Analyzes text data to distinguish between real and fake news
- *Jupyter Notebook Implementation*: Interactive notebook for experimentation and visualization
