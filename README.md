Quantum Support Vector Machine for COVID-19 Fake News Detection1. Project OverviewThis study investigates the application of Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for detecting COVID-19 misinformation on social media1. The primary goal is to evaluate if quantum kernel-based classification can provide competitive performance against classical machine learning approaches, specifically when feature dimensions and training samples are limited2.Authors:SS Pavan Charan (2023BCS0078) 3Nikkath Zabeen (2023BCS0060) 4R Yadunath Reddy (2023BCS0077) 52. Motivation & Problem StatementThe COVID-19 pandemic caused a massive "infodemic" where false cures and misleading statistics spread rapidly6666. While classical machine learning is effective, it typically requires large-scale labeled datasets and high-dimensional text representations (5000+ features)7777.Objectives:Classify COVID-19-related tweets as fake or real using a hybrid quantum machine learning pipeline8.Assess whether quantum feature maps can exploit nonlinear patterns in low-dimensional settings (5-10 features) where classical kernels often struggle9999.3. MethodologyThe project employs a hybrid workflow that reduces classical feature dimensions to match available qubit counts10.3.1 Architecture PipelineText Preprocessing: Cleaning tweets by removing URLs, usernames, hashtags, special characters, and converting to lowercase 11.Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF to convert tweets into high-dimensional sparse vectors12.Dimensionality Reduction: Applying Truncated SVD to reduce features to 5 or 10 dimensions to match the number of quantum qubits13.Quantum Feature Encoding: Mapping classical data into a high-dimensional Hilbert space using quantum circuits14.Quantum Kernel Estimation: Calculating the similarity between samples via the quantum kernel matrix15.Classification: Using a classical SVM solver with the computed quantum kernel to predict labels16161616.3.2 Quantum ApproachEncoding: The feature map uses RY (linear values) and RZ (nonlinear squared values) rotations, along with CZ gates to entangle qubit pairs 17.Hilbert Space: With 10 SVD components mapping to 10 qubits, the system utilizes a $2^{10}=1024$-dimensional Hilbert space18.Kernel Calculation: The kernel $K_{ij}$ represents the squared fidelity between two quantum states: $K_{ij}=|\langle\phi(x_{i})|\phi(x_{j})\rangle|^{2}$19.4. Experimental SetupDataset: Over 10,000 balanced COVID-19 tweets (Real vs. Fake) with an average length of 12-13 words 20.Hardware/Simulation: CPU-based statevector simulation21.Tools: Python, scikit-learn, PennyLane + lightning.qubit simulator, NumPy/Pandas 22.Configurations:Classical: Linear SVM (Full TF-IDF) and RBF SVM (SVD reduced to 5-10 dims)23.Quantum: QSVC with 5 and 10 qubits, trained on subsets of 500, 1500, and 2500 samples24242424.5. Key ResultsThe study compares Classical Linear SVM, Classical RBF SVM, and QSVC.ModelFeature SetupAccuracyInsightLinear SVMFull TF-IDF (5000 dims)0.93Best overall performance; text data is linearly separable in high dimensions252525.RBF SVMSVD Reduced (10 dims)0.85Accuracy drops as SVD compresses too much information26.QSVC10 Qubits (10 dims)0.82Matches classical RBF performance in low dimensions272727.QSVC5 Qubits (5 dims)0.75Limited capacity due to small feature space28.Key Findings:While classical SVMs outperform quantum models on full feature spaces, the quantum approach becomes competitive when dimensions are restricted to 5-1029.Quantum feature maps effectively exploit nonlinear patterns in small feature spaces, whereas classical kernels lose power significantly under the same restrictions30303030.Increasing quantum training samples beyond 1500 yielded diminishing returns due to the saturation of circuit expressiveness31.6. Future DirectionsScale Up: Increasing qubit count and circuit depth to capture more complex interactions32.Quantum Embeddings: Implementing direct quantum word embeddings instead of relying on TF-IDF and SVD33.Hardware Testing: Running the QSVC on real quantum hardware (IBM Q, IonQ) to test the impact of noise34.Multilingual Support: Applying QSVC to multilingual fake news datasets35.
